# Ticketing system Evaluation

This is a central point of collaboration for evaulating the purchase of a ticketing system. 

## Phase 1 

Phase 1 will set forth the criteria used when evaluating software. We will use weighted averages for each criteria to set the importance of the feature. 
The current criteria and weights can be found [Here](https://github.com/Aalter-via/Ticketing-Eval/blob/main/main.md)
## Phase 2

In phase 2 we should choose vendors that we are interested in evaluating. Demos should be spun up for hands on evaluation. Salespersons will be notified. 

## Phase 3

Software will be evaluated based on our criteria. Weights will be calculated and a decision can be made. 

## Phase 4

If greenlit we will begin implementing the roll-out of the software.
